#### [Calculating a 20% Tip (HTML; JS)](https://github.com/helenism/project-restaurant/blob/master/tip.html)
Each time the customer clicks a button to enter the price of a purchase, it is added to a list. When the customer clicks the second button, the total price and the 20% tip are calculated and shown.
