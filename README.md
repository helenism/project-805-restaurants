# Project: 805 Restaurants

This is a work in progress of my restaurant project.805 Restaurants is a Nigerian restaurant in London which I like. They do not have a menu webpage, so I decided to build it myself.

#### [805 Resturants Menu Webpage](https://github.com/helenism/project-805-restaurants/blob/master/805-restaurants-menu.html)
An interactive and responsive webpage with the resturant's menu. Sample images will be included.
